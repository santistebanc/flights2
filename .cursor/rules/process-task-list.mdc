# Task List Management

**NOTE:** For all project-wide task completion, PRD change management, and workflow protocols, defer to `.cursor/rules/project-management.mdc`. This file only contains additional details for task list formatting and maintenance.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**

   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol in project-management.mdc.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Add newly discovered tasks.
3. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
4. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
5. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

AI: "This change is not mentioned in the PRD. Would you like me to update the PRD to include this requirement? This will ensure the change is properly documented and tracked."
User: "Yes"
AI: [Updates PRD with UI/UX requirements, updates task list, then implements the change]
