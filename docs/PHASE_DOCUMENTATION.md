- â›” Advanced UI, caching, and data quality not started (Phases 9-10, 13+)

## Recent Achievements (Phase 7 Completion)

1. **âœ… Multi-Source Framework**: Implemented MultiSourceScraper with parallel processing
2. **âœ… Kiwi and Sky Integration**: Both scrapers working with proper configuration
3. **âœ… TypeScript Errors Resolved**: All compilation errors fixed, development environment stable
4. **âœ… Development Environment**: Backend and frontend running successfully
5. **âœ… Database Queries**: Sample data accessible and queries working properly

## Current Blockers

1. **Live Data Storage**: Need to connect scrapers to database mutations
2. **Data Deduplication**: Implement unique ID generation and duplicate prevention
3. **Real-time Updates**: Connect scraping results to UI updates

## Next Immediate Steps (Phase 8: Database Integration)

1. **Connect Scrapers to Database**:

   - Create mutations to store flight data from scrapers
   - Implement unique ID generation for flights, bundles, and booking options
   - Add data validation before storage

2. **Implement Data Deduplication**:

   - Use existing helper functions for unique ID generation
   - Prevent duplicate flights and bundles
   - Handle booking option updates

3. **Real-time Data Flow**:

   - Connect scraping results to database storage
   - Update UI to show real-time scraping progress
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations

4. **Test End-to-End Flow**:
   - Validate complete scraping â†’ storage â†’ display pipeline
   - Test with multiple sources and data types
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency

## Phase 8 Success Criteria

- [ ] Scrapers store data in database via mutations
- [ ] Unique ID generation prevents duplicates
- [ ] Real-time data updates in UI
- [ ] Error handling for database operations
- [ ] Data validation before storage
- [ ] End-to-end testing successful
